This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


here i have used next js with react,typescript for server-side rendering and used tailwind CSS for styling  and Integrated the Open Food Facts API.
I have implemented dual search modes  name based and Barcode based.
Built a dynamic filtering system for categories and real-time sorting for Nutrition Grades (A-E) and product names.
I implemented a "Load More" stratege to provide  better ux.
responsive for all type of screens.
used react hooks for state management because of this small scale app.
